# Native Modules

thirty bees has created quite a number of native modules that come bundled with every installation as well as some which are available for download.  We will attempt to extensively document all these modules within these pages.  

If you ever find any bugs or encounter any issues, we encourage you to submit them to our bug tracker so we can get them fixed!

## Compatibility

thirty bees has designed all native modules to be comptabile with most current PrestShop 1.6 themes and modules.  Some tweaks may be required in certain instances.  This will hold true until the next major release of thirty bees (v2.0) expected sometime in the next 2 years.

## Updates

thirty bees will keep all native modules in v1 updated and supported for at least the next 2 years.  If there is enough community support and demand, then even longer.
