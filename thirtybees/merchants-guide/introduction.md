## Understanding thirty bees

Before logging in and getting to it, lets first go over thirty bees.  In general, there are two main aspects of you store, the front and back end.  The front end refers to the "face" of your store, or in other words, what your customers see when they visist (eg. https://yourdomain.com).  You can generally customize what appears where via hooks and modules (more on that later in the guide).  You can also get additional themes to change the layout, color, and look.  

The back end (admin area, dashboard) on the other hand is where you and your employees login and administer the store (eg. (https:/yourdomain.com/admin(Random-Characters).  This is where you setup your store, manage your catalog of products, process your orders, and more.

There are many customizations that can be made to your store to have it stand out among the crowd.  Themes can be created or purchased, which change the design (layout, look, colors, etc.) of your front end.  You can also add further functionality or enhancements with modules from 3rd party vendors, or further code your own enhancements and customizations.
