Before logging in and getting to it, lets first go over thirty bees.  In general, there are two main aspects of you store, the front and back end.  The front end refers to the "face" of your store, or in other words, what your customers see when they visist (eg. https://yourdomain.com).  You can generally customize what appears where via hooks and modules (more on that later in the guide).  You can also get additional themes to change the layout, color, and look.  

The back end on the other hand is where you and your employees login and administer the store (eg. (https:/yourdomain.com/admin(Random-Characters).  This is where you setup your store, manage your catalog of products, process your orders, and more.
