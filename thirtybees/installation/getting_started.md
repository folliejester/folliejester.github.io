Since you have your domain, its time to think about a server.  There are a few things to keep in mind when searching for the right one: price, server specifications, proximity of host to your target market, shared vs private, among others.

Generally speaking, shared hosting is the cheapest and bare minimum you can get.  While this may suite some sites with small quantities of items and low traffic, more heavily visited shops will require higher powered servers.

**WARNING**  There are some users who claim using heavily utilized share hosting companies (such as godaddy and the like) result in random spikes and slow speeds due to others on the same server taxing the environment. 

It is advised to get hosting which guarantees a certain amount of processor cores and ram so you are not slowed down by others sharing your server resources.

You can do a search for hosting providers and choose the right one for your needs and budget (just don't forget the requirements noted above) or visit our website and look over our [trusted hosting partners](https://thirtybees.com/partners/hosting-partners/).

## FTP Client & Editor

In order to transfer files from one place to another, most often FTP (File Transfer Protocol) is used.  You can search ftp clients and find many that may suite your needs as well as quick descriptions on how they work.  A free one that is widely used is FileZilla, but feel free to use whichever you prefer.

You may also need to edit your configuration files, in which case you may need an editor.  You can likeswear search for editors and find a whole host of options.  Use what you prefer, whether Notepad, Sublime3, Notepad++, or others.
